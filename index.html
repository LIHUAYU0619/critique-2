      <div style="text-indent:3em;">With a piece of melodious music.<br></div>
      <div style="text-indent:3em;">Ordinary scenery of a town. Nature. Sawmill.</div>

      <div style="text-indent:3em;">The lonesome foghorn blows.</div>
      <div style="text-indent:3em;">Not far away, something plastic lying on the beach.<br></div>
      <div style="text-indent:3em;">Get close, it was a dead body.<br></div>
      <div style="text-indent:3em;">A body of a young girl.<br></div>
      <div style="text-indent:3em;">  Her hair falling down, sharing the similar curve with the candles on the screen.</div>

      <br>
      <div style="text-indent:3em;"><span class="blink_me_2">“She's dead. Wrapped in plastic.”</span><br><br></div>
      <div style="text-indent:3em;">Who killed her. An eternal mystery.<br><br></div>
      I believe this is one of the best American TV series. Without it, many subsequent series may not appear. It is not accidental that they were based on the semblable story: the death of a young girl, a small town surrounded by natural scenery,
      ghastly secrets in the forest. Everyone in the town has inextricable relationship, and under the seemingly peaceful appearance, each of them has hidden intent to the death.<br><br>
      <div style="text-indent:3em;">The death was a butterfly effect.</div>
      <br>
      From <i>True Detective</i>, <i>Sharp Objects</i> to <i>Parfum</i>...a young girl is usually regarded as the representative of beauty. But the action of destroying a beauty itself is also so cruel and beautiful. The underneath dark side of
      human was being revealed. Such destruction can be also glimpsed in the Dogtown. However, the especial difference here is the natural metaphors being used.<br><br>
      The winding streams extends from warm colors nearby to cold green mountains in the distance. They are only used as a background, but the mystery of the Mona Lisa is half attributed to the strange scenery behind it. There are definitely various
      styles of landscape in the world, but Friedrich from the Romanticism has the closest gloomy and terrifying connection here. The quiet and empty atmosphere in the painting exudes a mysterious and pious religious image. The hideous portrayal of
      the dead tree blends with the painter’s inside body, like talons protruding from the heart.

      The slowly flowing water in the picture reminds me of another painting, <i>Isle of the Dead</i> by Arnold Böcklin. In a small boat, the rower and Charon, the goddess of ferry, wrapped in white, glided across the dark lake and approached a small island
      with rocks and cypresses. The white cloth covered on the boat is a coffin. The painter has painted around five different version of the same subject. I guess he must be quite attached to death. Although there was not any public announcement
      from the artist, he only explained this is a dream picture, which must produce such a stillness that one would be awed by a knock on the door. Back to the screen, after the melting, the gradual flow in the blue is a way to the gate of hell—the wicked gel smile of Satan and a twisty “<span class="re">ℜ𝔈𝔔𝔘ℑ𝔈𝔐</span>”. When I received the music playlist, I knew that here came a coincidence. In 1905, Rachmaninov inspired by <i>Isle of the Dead</i> and created a symphonic poem with the same name. He repeatedly used the speed of 5/8 to depict the
      rowing motion in the painting, or the motion of flowing water. In the poem, he also borrowed the Latin chant <i>Dies Irae</i>—one part of the ℜ𝔈𝔔𝔘ℑ𝔈𝔐—in order to imply death.<br><br>
      <div style="text-indent:3em;">Standing at the top of the mountains, the <i>Wanderer above the Sea of Fog</i> staring
      at the mountains.<br></div>
      <div style="text-indent:3em;">Standing in front of the small ripple and dead branch, a young girl staring in fear.</div>

      <div style="text-indent:3em;">Red is fire. Red is blood. Red is the fiery dismay.<br></div>
      <div style="text-indent:3em;"><span class="blink_me_1">Green</span> is the opposite. <span class="blink_me_2">Green</span> is the gruesome.<br></div>
      <div style="text-indent:3em;">In some games, they would made the color of blood <span class="blink_me_3">green</span>.<br></div>
      <div style="text-indent:3em;"><span class="blink_me">Green</span> is cold blood.<br>

      <div style="text-indent:3em;">The murderer always turned out to be a human. Nature reflects the inside of a human.<br></div>

      I anticipate to be led into a horror world, about to embark on a journey of death. The website seems to be a good starting point, but I wondering if there can be more paths leading the way to tell a bigger story. And I also wondering if there
      can be more terrified details in this prodigal.travel, like the moment Agent Cooper using a tweezer to dig out a small piece of R from the dead girl’s nail. That moment gave me goose bumps.<br><br>

      The same melody sounded over and over again at different times, running through <i>Twin Peaks</i>. I downloaded the music to mp3 long ago before I watched the series. Later, I knew about the story of this piece being made. When David Lynch
      described the scene in his mind for the composer Badalamanti, he said: “There was breeze through the dark forest, the moon was rising, and animals were making different sounds in the background. You can hear the scream from the owls. That was a
      gentle and tenebrous feeling in the meantime.”
